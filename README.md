# Exploring Weather Trends Project
Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree - Project 1

# Instructions
In this project, I will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends. So, my goal will be to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where we live.

# Steps
1. Extract the data from the database using SQL.
2. Create a line chart
3. Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and my cityâ€™s averages, as well as overall trends.

# Submission
The final analysis I will take the form of a PDF document which contains a plot of the data, analysis of said plot and outlines the steps taken:

- An outline of steps taken to prepare the data to be visualized in the chart, such as:
- What tools did I use for each step? (SQL, Excel, etc)
- How did I calculate the moving average?
- What was my key considerations when deciding how to visualize the trends?
- Line chart with local and global temperature trends
- At least four observations about the similarities and/or differences in the trends
